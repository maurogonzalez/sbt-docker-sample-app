## SBT Docker Sample App

### Requirements

* git
* JDK 8
* sbt >= 0.13
* docker-compose >= 1.11 (Only for local integration test)

### Usage

#### Test
```
$ sbt test
```

**Start the application**

To build the application's Dockerfile use:
```
$ sbt docker:stage
```
And before the `docker-compose up` above command run:
```
$ docker-compose build
```
Start container with your app:
```
$ docker-compose up
```
* Run the application in _watch mode_ ( `~re-start` watches changes in code and compile them before restarting the service):
```
#!shell
  $ sbt 
  > ~re-start
```

* Simply run the application:
```
  $ sbt run
```

With the service up, you can start sending HTTP requests:

**Status service**
```
$ curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/sample-app/status
```


**Name service**
```
$ curl -X POST \
    http://127.0.0.1:8080/sample-app/name \
    -H 'content-type: application/json' \    
    -d '{
  	"name": "Mauro"
  }'
```

## Notes
* Use functions, functions and more functions! (Type, compose, reuse, partial and play them =D)

* Type almost all your functions, those that are not trivial ;). This is real documentation!

* Use [Scala pattern matching](http://docs.scala-lang.org/tutorials/tour/pattern-matching.html)
( [Pattern matching](http://wiki.c2.com/?PatternMatching) )
